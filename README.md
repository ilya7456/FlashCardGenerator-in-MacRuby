FlashCardGenerator-in-MacRuby
=============================

The imported text file is automatically splitted and then the random flashcards a generated and exported as text file

Instructions
-------------
Just Following basic steps top to bottom
-Browse Files -- open the .txt file with a bunch of words and defenitions to it
-Choose the size of the card -- self-explanatory, can be changed later
-Generate FlashCard -- picks N random words and puts on the same card (tabs on the right for previewing)
-Repeate two previous steps until the desired result
-Add Card to stack
-Generate more cards using same steps
-Enter genral name for the deck
-Export FlashCard - if more than one card, the cards are numerated
-"Success notification!!!!"

To Do
-------
-Add "common symbol" for detecting lines with defenitions, "(" by default, 
beacuse I took my word list from pdf and it had a lot of trash, so only needed lines contained "("
-Export as a better format, I was thinking of "csv", so I can write the actual FlashCards app

Hidden Features
-----------------
Just accidentally realized that it supports multiple different .txt files imported to be combined in one deck.
May be should add support for multiple sources not just for a deck but for the same Flash Card
